## Description

The Configuration Policy Controller watches `ConfigurationPolicies`, and checks if the specified objects are present in the cluster. It records compliancy details in the `status` of each ConfigurationPolicy, and as Kubernetes Events. If set to `enforce` the configuration, then the controller will attempt to create, update, or delete objects on the cluster as necessary to match the specified state. The controller can be run as a stand-alone program or as an integrated part of governing risk with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes.

This is an example spec of a `ConfigurationPolicy` object:
```yaml
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-pod-example
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  severity: low
  namespaceSelector:
    exclude: ["kube-*"]
    include: ["default"]
  object-templates:
    - complianceType: musthave
      objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: sample-nginx-pod
        spec:
          containers:
          - image: nginx:1.18.0
            name: nginx
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

The `ConfigurationPolicy` spec includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| severity | Optional: `low`, `medium`, or `high`. |
| remediationAction | Required:  `inform` or `enforce`. Determines what actions the controller will take if the actual state of the object-templates does not match what is desired. |
| namespaceSelector | Optional: an object with `include` and `exclude` lists, specifying where the controller will look for the actual state of the object-templates, if the object is namespaced and not already specified in the object. |
| object-templates | Required: A list of Kubernetes objects that will be checked on the cluster. |

Additionally, each item in the `object-templates` includes these fields:

| Field | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| complianceType | Required: `musthave`, `mustnothave` or `mustonlyhave`. Determines how to decide if the cluster is compliant with the policy. |
| objectDefinition | Required: A Kubernetes object which must (or must not) match an object on the cluster in order to comply with this policy. |

## Run

To run the controller locally, point your CLI to a running cluster and then run:
```
export WATCH_NAMESPACE=cluster_namespace_on_hub
go run cmd/manager/main.go
```
